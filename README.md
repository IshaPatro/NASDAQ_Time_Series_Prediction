## Problem Statement  
The NASDAQ index reflects the performance of the tech-heavy stock market and is closely watched by investors and analysts. In this project, I aim to build a predictive model using historical NASDAQ data to estimate how well such models could have predicted past market behavior. The focus is on evaluating different time series techniques in a historical context to understand their accuracy and limitations.

## Stakeholder & User  
The primary users are data-driven investors, financial analysts, or researchers interested in assessing the reliability of time series models for market prediction. This project supports model evaluation rather than live forecasting, and the results could inform future development of trading strategies.

## Useful Answer & Decision  
The goal is to build a **predictive model** that is trained and tested on historical data to forecast values within that time range.
