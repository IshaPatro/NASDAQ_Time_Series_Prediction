# NASDAQ Time Series Prediction 📈

A comprehensive analysis and prediction model for NASDAQ market trends using advanced time series techniques and technical indicators.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project develops a sophisticated time series prediction model for the NASDAQ index, incorporating multiple technical indicators and advanced data preprocessing techniques. The goal is to understand market behavior patterns and evaluate the effectiveness of various predictive modeling approaches on historical financial data.

## 👥 Target Audience

- **Data-driven investors** seeking quantitative insights into market trends
- **Financial analysts** evaluating time series modeling techniques
- **Researchers** interested in financial market prediction methodologies
- **Data scientists** exploring real-world time series applications

## 🧭 Problem Statement

The NASDAQ index serves as a critical benchmark for technology-heavy market performance. This project aims to:

- Build robust predictive models using comprehensive historical NASDAQ data
- Evaluate the accuracy and limitations of time series forecasting techniques
- Provide insights into market behavior patterns through technical analysis
- Establish a foundation for future trading strategy development

**Note:** This project focuses on model evaluation and historical analysis rather than live trading recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Data Processing Pipeline
1. **Data Import & Cleaning**: Load historical NASDAQ data with proper column naming
2. **Date Processing**: Convert strings to datetime objects for proper chronological sorting
3. **Technical Indicators**: Calculate comprehensive suite of financial metrics
4. **Null Handling**: Strategic domain-specific filling for incomplete rolling calculations
5. **Validation**: Ensure data integrity and completeness

### Technical Indicators Implemented
- **Daily Returns**: `(Close[t] - Close[t-1]) / Close[t-1]`
- **Log Returns**: `ln(Close[t] / Close[t-1])`
- **Moving Averages**: Simple moving averages over 5, 10, and 20 periods
- **Volatility**: Rolling standard deviation of returns
- **RSI**: Momentum oscillator indicating overbought/oversold conditions
- **Bollinger Bands**: Volatility bands around moving average

## 💡 Methodology

### Null Value Handling Strategy
Our approach uses domain-specific knowledge for handling missing values:

- **Returns**: Fill with 0 (logical for first day with no prior data)
- **Moving Averages**: Use current closing price as initial estimate
- **Volatility**: Apply low volatility value (0.01) for initial periods
- **RSI**: Use neutral value (50) indicating balanced market conditions
- **Bollinger Bands**: Initialize with closing price values

This strategic approach preserves data integrity while maintaining the statistical properties essential for time series analysis.

## 📊 Data Insights

The processed dataset includes:
- **Date Range**: 2015-08-17 to 2025-08-14 (10 years of data)
- **Total Records**: 2,517 trading days
- **Features**: 16 columns including price data and technical indicators
- **Data Quality**: 100% complete after strategic null handling

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Models**: LSTM, ARIMA, and Prophet implementations
- **Feature Engineering**: Additional technical indicators and market sentiment data
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive backtesting and performance metrics
- **Interactive Visualization**: Dynamic charts and real-time analysis tools
- **Risk Management**: Portfolio optimization and risk assessment features
